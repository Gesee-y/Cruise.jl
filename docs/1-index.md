# Cruise Engine v0.3.0: A Powerful Game Engine in Julia

Welcome to the official documentation for **Cruise**, a modular, high-performance game engine built with Julia.

This guide will walk you through the core concepts and essential features of the engine. Whether you're developing a small prototype or a complex game system, Cruise gives you fine control over every subsystem, thanks to its composable architecture and plugin system.

You’ll also find practical examples showing how to apply each concept in a real game context.
